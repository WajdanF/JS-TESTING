Install the npm by doing: "npm install webpack-dev-server@(version number)"
Next is to webpack.config.js and add to the module.exports: 
    devServer:{
        contentBase: path.resolve(__dirname,'dist'),//where the base directly is to uplaod to server (absoulte path)
        //^ The folder where the index file is
        
        publicPath:'/assets/' //where the js is being served up from (the folder)
    }


Next is add script to package.json: "serve": "webpack-dev-server" OR "serve": "webpack serve --open" if the first one does not work



TO MAKE BUNDLE AND SPIT OUT CODE (BABEL AND WEBPACK TOGETHER):
remove -w from the webpack script and add --mode production at the end
next add the --mode development to the serve script

Then install npm package: "npm install babel-loader --save-dev" to download the loader for babel

Then go to the webpack.config.js and add this to the module.exports:
 
 module:{
        rules:[{//each object is a rule
            test:/\.js$/, //anyfile that is a js file //which files we want to run through the lo   aders
            exclude: /node_module/, //skips over the node_module
            //^ js file that is not in nodemodule
            
            use:{
                loader:'babel-loader',
                options:{
                    presets:['@babel/preset-env']
                }
            }
        }]
    }

Then run "node_modules/.bin/webpack --mode production" in the terminal or "npm run webpack"
