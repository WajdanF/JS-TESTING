use "npm init" first
use "npm install @babel/core @babel/cli --save-dev"
then use "npm install @babel/preset"
setup file called ".babelrc" with:
"{
    "presets":["@babel/preset-env"]
}"

To call babel do: "node_modules/.bin/babel 'filename' -o 'new_filename' "


To make projects we first create a src folder which we write our own code in, then
create a dist folder with the babel converted js

TO MAKE BABEL FASTER:

go to package.json, then scripts, then add "babel": "node_modules/.bin/babel src/index.js -o dist/assets/bundle.js" or whatever the script is.
To run the script type in: npm run "script name" or in our case "babel", so it looks like "npm run babel"

TO AUTOMATE THE PROCESS AND LOOK FOR CHANGES AUTOMATICALLY:
use this script instead: "node_modules/.bin/babel 'filename' -w -o 'new_filename' "
^ The -w wathes for changes in the previous file and automatically runs the script (when saved), but you do have to run the babel script first in the cmd
