Make a file called "webpack.confi.js" and paste in: 
"
const path = require('path');//requiring a path/module from node

module.exports = {
    entry:'./src/index.js',//file we want (input almost) where the source file lives (relative path)

    output: {//where we want to output to
        path:path.resolve(__dirname,'dist/assets'),//__dirname gets the absolute path to the folder webpack.config is in
        //resolve takes in 2 paths we want to combine (absolute path)

        filename: 'bundle.js'//filename we save as
    }

};//exports a webpack config

"

Then install the webpack and webpack-cli by using "npm install webpack webpack-cli --save-dev" in the terminal in the folder with nodejs

Then run the webpack by doing "node_modules/.bin/webpack" in the terminal (powershell)

Then go to the package.json and make a new script called "webpack:node_modules/.bin/webpack" and
to run it call "npm run webpack"
